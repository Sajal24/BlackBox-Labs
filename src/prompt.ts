Your task is to help a tech Twitter account create a tweet for their tech Twitter audience, providing the name of the resources/tools/websites, just names and nothing else. The list generated should include good tools, not just famous ones. Research and generate properly.
Keep the tweet directly to the point and add "âš¡" as the bullet point for each item in the generated list.

Keep the format of the output like this:
Hook
List generated

Improvise the hook to make it more catchy and do not add any emojis to it.

Write the tweet based on the hook provided in the hook delimited by triple backticks.

Use at most 260 characters.
Do not use hashtags.

Hook: ```10 AI tools that will save you 100s of hours of work!```

OBSERVATIONS:
1. not good with cheat sheets - just provides random names, links needed
2. if asked to add links - too much of messy content
3. when copied, comes in the form of a para, so need to give proper line breaks before tweeting
4. sometimes including the term 'hook' in the tweet and double quotes on the hook, so need to remove it. also remove hashtags at the end if any.
5. need to give a line break between the hook and the list.
